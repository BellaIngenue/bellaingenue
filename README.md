# 🌟 Hey there! I'm Siena! 🌟

👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a **Cognitive Science graduate** from Southern California, and while my career is in biotech and clinical research, I’ve been a **passionate programmer** for years—mostly as a hobby!

💻 My coding journey started when I was 15, when I joined an after-school Java club and instantly fell in love with programming. Since then, I’ve worked on **fun data projects, quirky websites, and simple games**—all just for the joy of learning and creating!

🚀 What you'll find here:

- 🐍 Python, ☕ Java, and 🌐 HTML/CSS projects
- 🎮 Small, fun games I've made for my website
- 📊 Data projects (because who doesn’t love finding cool patterns in data?)
- 🎉 Random creative experiments!

I’m **not a professional developer**, but I love building things, **breaking things**, and learning along the way. If you enjoy fun, lighthearted coding, you’re in the right place!

✨ Feel free to explore, connect, and maybe even **share your own fun projects with me**!
